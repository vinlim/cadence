# About Us
Blockonomics is a privacy-first bitcoin payment company. It's core features are
- Privacy first - We retain the most minimal possible user data to ensure system functionality, and all transaction
  records are automatically removed in 3 months
- Non-custodial - We uses user's Xpub to generate Bitcoin addresses used for payments, and track those addresses and
  provide payment process callback. This approach ensure we do not have access to the user's fund, eliminating
- Limited KYC - For the reason that we do not have access to the user's fund, and that we do not process the said fund,
  only limited KYC is required for regulatory compliance

# Brand Tone
- Because we are a payment company, business rely on us with their money. Thus, we have to portray trustworthiness and
  reliability.
